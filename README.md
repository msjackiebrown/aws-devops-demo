## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This application is designed to be deployed using an AWS CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Source Control**: GitHub repository
2. **Build**: AWS CodeBuild using buildspec.yml
3. **Test**: Automated testing with Jest for unit and integration tests
4. **Deployment**: AWS CodeDeploy to EC2 instances using appspec.yml

## Testing

The application uses Jest for comprehensive testing:

### Test Structure

- `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for individual JavaScript functions
- `tests/integration/`: Integration tests for application flow
- `tests/setup.js`: Common setup for all tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

Our test suite aims for high code coverage with:

- Unit tests for individual functions in main.js
- Integration tests for complete application flow
- DOM event handling tests
- User interaction simulation

Current coverage metrics:
- Statement coverage: ~90%
- Branch coverage: ~56%
- Function coverage: ~84%
- Line coverage: ~90%

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- GitHub account

### Setting Up the Pipeline

1. Push this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create an AWS CodePipeline with the following stages:
   - Source: Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Build: Use AWS CodeBuild with the included buildspec.yml
   - Deploy: Use AWS CodeDeploy with the included appspec.yml

## Local Development

To run this application locally, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

# Repository Notifications

Repository notifications keep team members informed about changes to the codebase and pipeline status. This project implements notifications across multiple layers for comprehensive visibility.

## 1. GitHub Repository Notifications

GitHub's built-in notification system provides team awareness of repository activities:

### üì£ Watching Repositories
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Watch Repository** | Receive notifications for issues, PRs, and commits |
| **Configuration** | Repository ‚Üí "Watch" dropdown ‚Üí Select notification level |
| **Options** | All Activity, Releases Only, Ignore |

### üìß Email and Web Notifications
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Email** | Notifications delivered based on GitHub settings |
| **Web** | Accessible via bell icon in GitHub navigation bar |
| **Setup** | GitHub Settings ‚Üí Notifications |

### üîç Custom Notification Routing
* Filter by repository, activity type, or reason
* Create rules to direct specific notifications to different email addresses

## 2. AWS CodePipeline Notifications

Pipeline execution notifications use Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):

### ‚öôÔ∏è SNS Topic Configuration
```bash
# Create a dedicated topic for pipeline notifications
aws sns create-topic --name pipeline-notifications
```

* **Subscription Types**: 
  - Email
  - SMS
  - Third-party integrations (Slack, Teams)

### üîÑ CodePipeline Integration

Pipeline events published to SNS include:
* Pipeline started
* Pipeline succeeded
* Pipeline failed
* Approval needed

### üìã Notification Rules Setup
1. AWS Console ‚Üí CodePipeline ‚Üí Select Pipeline ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notification Rules
2. Configure event types (state changes, approvals)
3. Select SNS topic as target

## 3. Status Monitoring

Visual indicators provide at-a-glance status information:

### üè∑Ô∏è Status Badge
GitHub status badge in README showing current build status:

![Build Status](https://codebuild.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=example-badge-id)

### üìä HTML Status Dashboard
* Simple dashboard for pipeline status and recent deployments
* Location: `/status/index.html`

## Implementation Guide

### GitHub Webhook Configuration
```bash
# Navigate to: Repository Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Add webhook
# Configure the following:
# - Payload URL: [Your endpoint]
# - Content type: application/json
# - Events: [Select relevant events]
```

### AWS SNS Setup
```bash
# Create SNS topic
aws sns create-topic --name pipeline-notifications

# Add email subscription
aws sns subscribe \
  --topic-arn [topic-arn] \
  --protocol email \
  --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
```

### CodePipeline Notification Rule
```bash
# Navigate to: AWS Console ‚Üí CodePipeline ‚Üí Pipeline ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notification Rules
# Configure:
# - Detail type: Basic or Full
# - Events: Pipeline state changes, approvals needed
# - Targets: SNS topic
```

### Validation Process
1. Make a minor repository change
2. Push to trigger the pipeline
3. Verify notification delivery via configured channels
